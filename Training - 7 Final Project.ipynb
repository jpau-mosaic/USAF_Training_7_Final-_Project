    "You can start with any of the datasets that were provided. They are all in the 'data' folder. Any of the previous notebooks can also be accessed in the 'code' folder. Use code from those notebooks as a template - copy, paste, and modify to your analysis needs. This is what professional data scientists do - we borrow and reuse code that we've written ourselves, that colleagues have share, or that is available online. If you run into any problems, take a look at the official Python, Pandas, or Matplotlib documentation. You can also search [Stack Overflow](www.stackoverflow.com) - one of the great things about popular open source tools like Python is that there is a huge community of users ready to support. Feel free also to ask the help of your classmates and instructors.\n",
